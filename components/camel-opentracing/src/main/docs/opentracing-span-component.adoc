For interacting with the active OpenTracing Span.
The AWS2 SQS component supports sending and receiving messages to
https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon's SQS] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon SQS. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon SQS].



== URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
opentracing-span://operation[?options]
------------------------------

The queue will be created if they don't already exists. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...



== URI Options

// component options: START
The OpenTracing Span component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The OpenTracing Span endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
opentracing-span:operation
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (3 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *operation* | *Required* The operation to perform on the active Span. The value can be one of: tag, log, setBaggage, getBaggage |  | SpanOperation
| *spanKey* | The tag or baggage item key on the Span. For tag or setBaggage operations it's the key that will be set on the Span, for getBaggage it's the key that will be used to retrieve from the Span. |  | String
| *valueHeader* | The name of the Exchange message header where the the value will be retrieved from or assigned to. For tag or setBaggage it's the name of the header whose value will be set on the Span, for getBaggage it's the name of the header where the value retrieved from the Span will be assigned to. |  | String

| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
